## 📘 Project Overview

This project introduces **an AI-driven Sinhala mobile application** designed to support **depression monitoring and mental health assistance**.  
The system integrates **chat-based and call-based** interactions in Sinhala and detects emotional states using **AI models** and **mobile phone sensors**.

The solution bridges the **gap in culturally relevant mental health support** for Sinhala-speaking communities by providing **real-time, adaptive, and privacy-conscious** assistance.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Detect depression levels through **AI-based Sinhala chatbot conversations and voice calls**.
- Monitor emotional and behavioral patterns via **typing analysis** and **sensor-based biofeedback**.
- Provide **personalized mental health support** and connect users to professionals in critical cases.
- Ensure **privacy, ethical compliance**, and **user confidentiality**.

---

## 🧩 Key Components

### 1. **AI-Driven Sinhala Chatbot with fake call ditetction**
- Real-time conversational agent (text + voice).
- Emotion detection and fake call detection from and call data.
- Empathetic and culturally aligned responses.

### 2. **Typing Behavior Analysis**
- Tracks Sinhala typing speed, pauses, and errors.
- Detects stress or emotional imbalance using keystroke dynamics.
- Privacy-preserving – does not store typed content.

### 3. **Biofeedback-Based Monitoring**
- Uses **smartphone sensors** (camera, mic, accelerometer, heart rate) to monitor biofeedback.
- Detects stress or depression levels (mild, moderate, severe).
- Adaptive UI that adjusts tone, visuals, and speed based on detected emotional state.

### 4. **Digital Twin Framework**
- Builds a virtual model of user’s mental health profile.
- Enables **real-time doctor connection** and **location tracking** during crises.
- Provides **personalized, data-driven insights** for long-term wellness.
